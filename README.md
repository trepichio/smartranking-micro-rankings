## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is just a project for learning purposes. It is not intended to be used in production. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy to use API for registering players and challenging each other and deliver a Ranking for them. The API is built using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework.

This API was built in two different architectures: [monolith REST API](https://github.com/trepichio/api-smartranking-backend-nestjs) and **microservices approaches**.

**This repository is ONLY the *Microservice Rankings* of the application built on the Microservices architecture.**

If you want to have a look at both the microservices architecture and the REST API, you can find them on the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/trepichio/SmartRanking).

### The Microservices Architecture

The microservices approach uses a [API Gateway](https://github.com/trepichio/smartranking-api-gateway) and a microservice architecture that communicates with each other through a messaging broker such as RabbitMQ.
A variety of microservices are used to provide the functionality of the API. The microservices are:
- [Admin](https://github.com/trepichio/smartranking-micro-admin-backend) - This microservice is responsible for registering new players and categories.
- [Challenges](https://github.com/trepichio/smartranking-micro-challenges) - This microservice is responsible for managing players' challenges and registering their match results.
- [Rankings](https://github.com/trepichio/smartranking-micro-rankings) - This microservice is responsible for providing a leaderboard.
- [Notifications](https://github.com/trepichio/smartranking-micro-notifications) - This microservice is responsible for sending notifications/e-mails to players.
- Authentication - AWS Cognito is used for authentication.
- File Storage - AWS S3
- Database - MongoDB Atlas

Following a non-complete diagram representation of the **microservices architecture approach** built:

![Microservices Architecture Approach Diagram](./src/static/assets/images/SmartRanking.Microservice_Rankings.svg)

Along the way, building this API I've learned the following technologies:
- a new server framework (NestJS) and how to build both a *monolith RESTful API* and a *Microservices oriented application*.
- how to host a RabbitMQ server and how to use it to create a *Message Queue* and *Message Broker*.
- how to use some AWS services such as *S3* and *EC2* to store and retrieve data, and *Cognito* to autenticate users.
- How to host a MongoDB server on cloud *MongoDB Atlas* and how to use it to store data.
- How to deploy a scalable *NodeJS* application using *Docker* and *Kubernetes* with *Cloud Foundry* on *SAP Business Platform (formerly SAP Cloud Platform)*.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites

You need a database server installed and running on your local machine or hosted on the cloud.
I've used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) hosted by [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) on this project.

You have to setup an AWS account in order to use the following AWS services: Cognito, EC2 and S3.
Then, you need to have a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) server running on your local machine or, preferably, hosted on the cloud.

After that, it's time to setup the project.

### Installing

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/trepichio/smartranking-micro-rankings.git
```


Enter the root folder of the cloned project and rename their `.env.example` file to `.env` and input values of their respectives variables on file in order to setup database, messaging broker and AWS Services.

The variables are pretty much self-explanatory.

Then, install dependecies. In your terminal, at root of project, run:

```
$ npm install
```

### Running
You are ready to go.
Open a terminal then run:

```
$ npm run start:dev
```

Now, you have the **Microservice Rankings** up and running! Check whether the other pieces of applications are running as well like the Messaging Broker, API Gateway and [the microservices](#the_microservices_architecture). Then, You can use any REST Client you like and consume any of API endpoints such as

```
GET http://localhost:8080/players HTTP/1.1.
```

If you use Visual Code there is a very useful extension that works like a REST Client. See [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client). Otherwise, you can use any REST Client you like.

In case, you decided to go and use this extension, enjoy the `request.rest` file I've already done for your usage. Enjoy! üòé


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

You can use the following endpoints:

- `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login`: Login a user and get a token.
- `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/signup`: Signup a user.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players`: This endpoint returns a list of players.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players/?playerId={id}`: This endpoint returns a player by ID.
- `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players`: This endpoint creates a new player.
- `PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players/{id}`: This endpoint updates a player by ID.
- `DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/players/{id}`: This endpoint deletes a player by ID.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories`: This endpoint returns a list of categories.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories/?categoryId={id}`: This endpoint returns a category by ID.
- `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories`: This endpoint creates a new category.
- `PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories/{id}`: This endpoint updates a category by ID.
- `DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/categories/{id}`: This endpoint deletes a category by ID.
- `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/challenges`: This endpoint creates a new challenge between two players.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/challenges/`: This endpoint returns a list of challenges.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/challenges/?playerId={id}`: This endpoint returns a list of challenges for a player.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/challenges/{challengeId}`: This endpoint returns a challenge by ID.
- `PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/challenges/{challengeId}`: This endpoint updates a challenge by ID. It should be used to accept or reject a challenge.
- `DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/challenges/{challengeId}`: This endpoint deletes a challenge by ID.
- `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/challenges/{challengeId}/match`: This endpoint adds a match for an already accepted challenge.
- `GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/rankings/?categoryId={id}&dateRef={date}`: This endpoint returns the leaderboard of a category within a period until the provided date reference.

For more information about the endpoints have a look at the `requests.rest` file located at the root of project folders.
